The floor is carpeted with impossibly vibrant rugs, the likes of which no mortal eye has seen, and the walls of the tent rise up so high that the ceiling cannot be seen.  A brazier glows softly, and above it hangs a golden teapot.  Vapors rising from its spout waft into the space, smelling of cinnamon and spices. There is a soft glowing stone by one side of the tent wall that looks like a flagstone crafted from an impossibly large pearl. The tent is warm and inviting, and a little unnervingly beautiful.  Truly, this is a place worthy of the Royal Family of the Alabaster Elves.",

It was said to have been a gift of the Elves of the North, and the magics of it allow for it to be as practical and durable as it is beautiful to behold.",
