    "description": "The sheer force of magic in the reservoir is so palpable. It is indeed a massive pool of liquid magic, shimmering with radiant energies of all colors and hues possible. The reservoir is in a secluded location and is the heart of the magic system. It is here magic is born and harnessed, before being piped around the world, in water-like form. This place is a testament to the ingenuity and spirit of the Ancient Mages who dared to bend the physical world to their will and create a powerful source for magic.",
