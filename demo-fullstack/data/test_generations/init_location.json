    "description": "It's a small, comfortable room, filled with cozy cushions and colorful blankets. Sunlight streams in through a half-open window, throwing warm rays onto Whisper's favorite rug. The shinny floorboards creak slightly under weight, a sound Whisper knows well. A beloved poster of distant, mystical mountains hangs on one of the walls, a reminder of Whisper's dreams of adventure.",
