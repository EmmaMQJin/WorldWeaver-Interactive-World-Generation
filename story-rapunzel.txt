Once upon a time, in a secluded tower hidden amidst a dense forest, lived Rapunzel, a young girl with long, magical golden hair. 
She was taken as a baby by a wicked witch, Mother Gothel, who used Rapunzel's hair to maintain her own youth. 
Rapunzel grew up believing the witch was her mother, unaware of her royal lineage. 
Each day, the witch climbed the tower using Rapunzel's hair as a rope. One day, a prince, drawn by Rapunzel's beautiful singing, discovered the tower. 
He returned several times, learning to climb up by Rapunzel's hair. 
The two formed a bond, and he proposed a plan for her escape. 
However, their plan was discovered, and in a fit of rage, the witch cut Rapunzelâ€™s hair and banished her. 
Eventually, the prince found Rapunzel in the wilderness, where they were joyously reunited, and her tears of joy healed his blindness from an earlier fall. 
Freed from her captor and restored with her true love, Rapunzel returned to her kingdom, where they both lived happily ever after.
