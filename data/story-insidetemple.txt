It speaks with the authority of ages past, offering safe passage to those who mean no harm to the sacred grounds it protects. Entrusted with the solemn duty to guard the treasures within, it remains ever vigilant, a testament to the grandeur and mystery of the royal lineage it serves. Adventurers who dare to venture into this hallowed place will find themselves facing not just the physical embodiment of protection but a piece of history, a keeper of secrets that has stood the test of time.
