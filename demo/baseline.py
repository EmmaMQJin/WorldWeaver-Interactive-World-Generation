The ... means you should expand with more actual items.

IMPORTANT RULES TO ABIDE BY:
- Be sure to populate all empty string fields
- DO NOT put any comments
- Generate 5 to 8 locations
- The player should be the first character in the "characters":[...] list
- Generate at least one character (NPC) in each location
- Generate at least 3 Inventory Items for each character
- Generate at least 3 Location Items in each location

Make sure you are GENERATING ENOUGH OF EVERYTHING
