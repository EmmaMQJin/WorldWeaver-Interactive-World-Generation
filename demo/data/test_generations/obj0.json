    "description": "Encircled by ancient trees, the lake presents an aura of mystery. Its clear, almost ethereal waters remain perpetually still, mirroring the old tales spun around it. The northern shore, bustling with uncanny rumors, acts as the starting point for an elusive hunt for a legendary giant fish. Nearby, a weathered dock peers into the lonesome depths, while a secluded lagoon hides far from prying eyes. Visible through the lake's transparency is Drinking Water City, an underwater metropolis said to rest at the lake's navel. This realm, where natural and supernatural blur into one strange reality, awaits those daring enough to uncover it.\n",
