    "description": "The vast expanse of the Costco parking lot stretches before you, filled with vehicles of all shapes and sizes. The smell of fresh asphalt and the faint hum of engine noise creates a thrum of modern day life. Here providence has placed you, a pigeon amongst the giant steel boxes. You can see people with shopping carts making their way to and from the exploitative superstore, their hands busily pushing carts filled with myriad goods. The monolithic facade of the store looms ominously in the distance.",
