    "description": "The temple foyer is a grand entrance with a soaring ceiling painted with the richest cobalt blue and ruby red paints in the entire land. Gold statues welcome the weary traveler with gods depicted in various states of repose. There are windows near the soaring ceilings that let in afternoon light from the east and the west and the floor is inlaid with the finest marble in all the land. A calm water fountain trickles peacefully in the center of the foyer.",
