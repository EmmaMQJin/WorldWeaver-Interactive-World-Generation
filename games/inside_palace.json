Even the wall above the door as you enter is a shelf full of books of all sorts. The smell of paper and some mold (they are rather old books) permeates the air. A large overstuffed settee is faced by a short table and across from that are two matching chair. All are brown in color and look to be extremely comfortable. The walls were once stone grey in color but the shelves totally cover them. The floor is covered in a lush, brownish rug that looks and feels more like fur. There are books piled on the floor by the chair and the short table is covered with them as well.
