You enter Toad Hollow through a drainage pipe that you have to crawl through. Once inside Toad Hollow, you can stand up, but you still don't feel comfortable with your surroundings. As far as the eye can see there is muddy water in a circular basin with lily pads floating in it. On the pads, giant toads jump back and forth making gurgling, croaking sounds. As you wade deeper into Toad Hollow, the water comes up to your waist and you see the flash of a fin. There is legend that a creature lives in the center of Toad Hollow that is half human, half monster. Not even the strongest knight has been brave enough to examine it. The fin disappears back underwater but there is a red glint suggesting eyes are watching you. When you reach the other side of the basin, you crawl into another drainage pipe and feel relieved that you're out of this place. Toad Hollow is a legend among knights young and old. Mostly, it's discovered by children playing down in the sewers who take a combination of turns through the drainage pipes and wind up there by accident. Some braze knights have purposefully tried to find Toad Hollow and been successful but most have not glimpsed the creature. Toad Hollow remains shrouded in mystery to this day and many question if it's even real. Some say that you should be careful not to get caught on the armor of the drowned when you're wading through and that hands have reached up from the bottom of the water and grabbed their ankles.",

As you wade deeper into Toad Hollow, the water comes up to your waist and you see the flash of a fin. There is legend that a creature lives in the center of Toad Hollow that is half human, half monster. Not even the strongest knight has been brave enough to examine it. The fin disappears back underwater but there is a red glint suggesting eyes are watching you.

Toad Hollow remains shrouded in mystery to this day and many question if it's even real.

You enter Toad Hollow through a drainage pipe that you have to crawl through. Once inside Toad Hollow, you can stand up, but you still don't feel comfortable with your surroundings. As far as the eye can see there is muddy water in a circular basin with lily pads floating in it. On the pads, giant toads jump back and forth making gurgling, croaking sounds. As you wade deeper into Toad Hollow, the water comes up to your waist and you see the flash of a fin. There is legend that a creature lives in the center of Toad Hollow that is half human, half monster. Not even the strongest knight has been brave enough to examine it. The fin disappears back underwater but there is a red glint suggesting eyes are watching you. When you reach the other side of the basin, you crawl into another drainage pipe and feel relieved that you're out of this place. Toad Hollow is a legend among knights young and old. Mostly, it's discovered by children playing down in the sewers who take a combination of turns through the drainage pipes and wind up there by accident. Some brave knights have purposely tried to find Toad Hollow and been successful but most have not glimpsed the creature. Toad Hollow remains shrouded in mystery to this day and many question if it's even real. Some say that you should be careful not to get caught on the armor of the drowned when you're wading through and that hands have reached up from the bottom of the water and grabbed their ankles.",
