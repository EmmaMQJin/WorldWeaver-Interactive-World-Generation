    "description": "In the heart of this cyberpunk city lies the Neon Jungle - a seemingly abandoned mega-zoo, now overrun by bio-engineered creatures and enveloped in an eerie blanket of neon mist. Animated shadows flicker hauntingly on the corroding metal fences, as the drone of advanced predatory beasts keep even the bravest souls at bay. This urban wilderness, illuminated by the spectral glow of neon lights, houses the entrance to the underworld, where the device of power is rumored to reside.\n",
