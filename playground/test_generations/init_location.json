    "name": "Neonopolis\n",
    "description": "Neonopolis is a futuristic dystopian city bathed in the permanent glow of neon lights, where the sky is always a dark electric blue and skyscrapers pierce the heavens. The city vibrates with the pulsing energy of countless cybernetic devices, and the air hums with the distant echo of electronic music and robotic chatter. The streets, dense with fog and heavy with the scent of ozone, are filled with people, androids, and combinations of both, their bodies augmented with cybernetic implants. Cybernetic billboards flash with a thousand advertisements, and screens display a future where everything is perfect - a stark contrast to the grime-covered city below.\n",
