        "description": "Neon City is an urban labyrinth with concrete walls scribbled with graffiti and towering skyscrapers which disappear into the smoky sky. Billboards flash with digital messages in various languages. The sound of incoming and outgoing traffic fills the air at all times, occasionally being overpowered by the boom of hovercrafts. The air is thick, almost tangible, filled with the scent of rain-soaked concrete, engine grease, cheerless cafes, and a hundred different types of citizens. It is home to both high-tech establishments and decrepit slums, a stark reminder of the disparity between those who benefit from the advanced technology and those who are left behind.\n",

As the doors ding open, you are greeted by the sterile, crisp environment of the Sky-high Tower. There is an immediate change from the hustle outside, into a quiet, efficient workspace."

Amidst ramshackle buildings, meandering wires form a complex network overhead, connecting disparate pieces of tech, some of which is quite advanced. It is a neighborhood filled with the hum of generators, the sputtering of old neon lights, and the determined spirit of those who refuse to be left behind.",
