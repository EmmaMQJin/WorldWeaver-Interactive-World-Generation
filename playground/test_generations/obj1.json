    "description": "This is a crumbled side of the Neon City, where people salvage technology and create makeshift cybernetics for their survival. Amidst ramshackle buildings, meandering wires form a complex network overhead, connecting disparate pieces of tech, some of which is quite advanced. It is a neighborhood filled with the hum of generators, the sputtering of old neon lights, and the determined spirit of those who refuse to be left behind.",

As you follow the rising sun, the meandering, wire-laced skyline gives way to towering skyscrapers and digital billboards, and the hum of barely-there generators is replaced by the constant melody of city traffic."
